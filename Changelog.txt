0.0.4 (???):
	- Tweaked slider bug where bouncing off of them was really unpredictable.
	Before, you traveled along the normal vector of the wedge with a magnitude
	of your current `y` velocity. Now, your velocity vector is just rotated to
	align with the normal vector of the collision. This should result in more
	sensible bouncing.
